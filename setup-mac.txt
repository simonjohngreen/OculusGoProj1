installing an app into the oculus.
==================================

connect it, click to attach usb to wondows

adb devices
#should show connected
#if not check the dispay and confirm
# note if it fails then use vmware and reattach the usb, make sure to set the action to open folder, seems to work

=================================
project Test2: Unity SampleScenes
=================================
this is for Rift, Touch, and Gear VR support, so I suspect i'm installing the wrong project initially.

I added this on top of the project above, not sire if thats a good idea yet.

installed from unity assets: Unity Sample Framework 

Then selected: SampleScenes: MixedRealityCapture:MRCTest 

in build settings I select add open scenes. 

build failed: The type or namespace name `OvrAvatar' could not be found. Are you missing an assembly reference?

google tells me I need to add this asset: Oculus Integration added it.

added and the build gets firther now. 

==================
build errors Test1
==================

1) 
Could not resolve all files for configuration ':classpath'.
   > Could not resolve com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.0.1.
     Required by:
         project :
      > Could not resolve com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.0.1.
         > Could not get resource 'https://dl.google.com/dl/android/maven2/com/android/tools/build/gradle/3.0.1/gradle-3.0.1.pom'.

               > sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target

point the browser to https://dl.google.com/dl/android/maven2/com/android/tools/build/gradle/3.0.1/
get the cert details, its dl.google.com

this is my path to the certs
/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jre/jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/security

source Environment.sh
keytool -list -keystore "/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jre/jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/security/cacerts"
password: changeit

check for the dl.google.com certificate, its missing. 

in chrome you can simply drag the dl.google.com.cer file to downloads. Then to install it..

keytool -import -noprompt -trustcacerts -alias dl.google.com.cer -file /Users/sgreen/Downloads/dl.google.com.cer -keystore "/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jre/jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/security/cacerts" -storepass changeit

still failed (possibly needs a reboot)
reboot worked, this error has cleared.
